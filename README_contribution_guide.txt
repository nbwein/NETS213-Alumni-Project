Write a step-by-step guide for how your classmates should make contributions to your project.
This should include where to access it, and who to contact if it isn't working or if they 
have any questions.

One can make contributions to our project by completing the HITs on CrowdFlower. If these
HITs are not working and/or you have any questions, you may contact any member of our group
(Danielle Frost, Lauren Silberberg, Greg Dikopf, Nick Wein). Note that the HITs may not all
be available at once, as each HIT is dependent on the results received from the HITs
listed before it (i.e. HIT 2 will not be available until all of the results for HIT 1 have
been collected, and so on). The HITs can be accessed via the following URLs:

1. Finding LinkedIn Profiles and Information: https://tasks.crowdflower.com/channels/cf_internal/jobs/897475/work?secret=i8rKszS%2Fgh5BQpKxP1SuhRvqf8HtMaLAnQ74sVCXpNoG
2. Validating Results for Finding LinkedIn Profiles and Information: currently unavailable
3. Finding Company and Personal Websites: currently unavailable
4. Validating Results For Finding Company and Personal Websites: currently unavailable

The first HIT asks workers to extract information about a SEAS alumnus from their LinkedIn
profile. The questions are conditional on the fact that the person's LinkedIn page can be
found. If the information requested is available on their profile, fill it in appropriately.
If not, write N/A.

The second HIT asks workers to confirm whether the information provided from the first HIT
is correct. The information will be provided as part of the data for this HIT. The worker
is expected to cross reference the information with the LinkedIn profile provided. There is
a simple Y/N question that the worker must answer. If all the information is correct, the
answer should be "Yes." If the URL for the LinkedIn profile is incorrect (e.g. it is the 
profile of someone with the same name but not the SEAS alumnus we are looking for), or if 
the LinkedIn profile URL is correct but any of the information extracted from it is 
incorrect, the answer to this question is "No." It is crucial that the information is
checked carefully, as it will be used in other HITs for this project conditional on the fact
that it is judged to be correct. 

The third HIT will provide workers with the name of an alumnus, a URL to their LinkedIn
profile, and the name of the current company at which they work, according to respones 
from the first HIT. This HIT asks workers to find more specific and personal information 
about the person that may not necessarily be on their LinkedIn profile, such as their 
current company's website, their personal website, and their email address. The worker is 
expected to use Google or any other resources they may consider to be helpful in order to
find thisinformation. If the information requested is unavailable, write N/A.

The fourth HIT will ask workers to confirm whether the information provided from the third HIT
is correct. It will be formatted the same way as the second HIT. It will provide workers
with the information extracted in the first HIT, which at this point has been judged to be
correct via the second HIT. It will then provide workers with the information provided from
the third HIT. Workers will be expected to check the correctness of the websites/email 
provided from the crowd's answers to the third HIT, conditional on the information provided
about the person. Again, workers will need to answer a simple Y/N question about whether 
the information provided from the third HIT is correct.
